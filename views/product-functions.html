             <h1>Product Functions</h1>
             <p>Be sure that the previous activity is complete. In this activity you will build two functions. One in the <b>products</b> model to query the database for products based on the category. The second will be a custom function in the <b>functions.php</b> file to use the array of products and build the HTML around it for display in the view.</p>

             <h2>Products Model</h2>
             <p>When we built the navigation bar we displayed the name of the category to be "human friendly". However, in the inventory table the products are associated with the categoryId, not the categoryName. We will use a SQL subquery to solve this issue for us.</p>
             <ol>
             <li>Find and open the "product" model in the <b>model</b> folder.</li>
              <li>Scroll to the bottom of the list of existing functions and add a new comment indicating that the new function will get a list of products based on the category.</li>
              <li>Add the key word "function" and then refer back to the controller for the function name and parameter you said would be used. Copy and paste the function name and parameter from the controller and paste them after the key word "function" and add the opening and closing curly braces, for example:
              <code class="callout no-left">
               function getProductsByCategory($type){<br>
               <br>
               }
               </code>
              </li>
              <li>Add the rest of the function as shown:
               <code class="callout no-left">
                function getProductsByCategory($type){<br>
                &nbsp;$db = acmeConnect();<br>
                &nbsp;$sql = 'SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE categoryId IN (SELECT categoryId FROM categories WHERE categoryName = :catType)';<br>
                &nbsp;$stmt = $db->prepare($sql);<br>
                &nbsp;$stmt->bindValue(':catType', $type, PDO::PARAM_STR);<br>
                &nbsp;$stmt->execute();<br>
                &nbsp;$products = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);<br>
                &nbsp;$stmt->closeCursor();<br>
                &nbsp;return $products;<br>
                }
               </code>
              </li>
              <li>Everything should look familiar with the possible exception of the SQL statement. Let's look at it now:
               <ul>
                <li>The first part is pretty basic: <i><code>SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE categoryId</code></i> - Get everything from the inventory table where the categoryId is...</li>
                <li>The second part, the subquery, is where we get the value to match with the categoryId: <i><code>IN (SELECT categoryId FROM categories WHERE categoryName = :catType)</code></i></li>
                <li>The keyword "IN" refers to the value to be returned from the subquery.</li>
                <li>The subquery asks for the categoryId based on a match of the categoryName in the database table that will match the categoryName (e.g. :catType) that we will send into the query as a named parameter.</li>
               </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If the function works as planned, we will send a "type" (e.g. Cannon) into the function based on the navigation link that was clicked. It will query the database and the subquery will find that the "Cannon" category has a categoryId of "1". It will then get a list of all the products and all of the product information where the product has a categoryId of "1".</li>
              <li>The array of products is then returned to the controller.</li>
              <li>Save the "accounts model".</li>
             </ol>

             <h2>Product HTML Function</h2>
             <p>You will recall that when we needed to take dynamic data returned from the database and wrap HTML structures around it, we used custom functons to do so. We will follow the same pattern here.</p>
             <ol>
             <li>Find and open the <b>functions.php</b> file in the <b>library</b> folder.</li>
              <li>Scroll to the bottom of the list of existing functions and add a new comment indicating that the new function will build a display of products within an unordered list.</li>
              <li>Build the balance of the function as shown:
              <code class="callout no-left">
               function buildProductsDisplay($products){<br>
               &nbsp;$pd = '&lt;ul id="prod-display"&gt;';<br>
               &nbsp;foreach ($products as $product) {<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;$pd .= '&lt;li&gt;';<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;$pd .= "&lt;img src='$product[invImage]' alt='Image of $product[invName] on Acme.com'&gt;";<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;$pd .= '&lt;hr&gt;';<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;$pd .= "&lt;h2&gt;$product[invName]&lt;/h2&gt;";<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;$pd .= "&lt;span&gt;$$product[invPrice]&lt;/span&gt;";<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;$pd .= '&lt;/li&gt;';<br>
               &nbsp;}<br>
               &nbsp;$pd .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';<br>
               &nbsp;return $pd;<br>
               }
               </code>
              </li>
              <li>When done, the function returns the variable <b>$pd</b> (e.g. product display) to the controller where it is stored as <code>$prodDisplay</code>. It is then ready to be used in the view.</li>
              <li>Save the <b>functions.php</b> file.</li>
              <li>We will test before moving on to the next activity where the view is actually built and styled.</li>
             </ol>

             <h2>Test Time</h2>
             <p>While we don't yet have a view, we can still test to make sure the process is working to this point.</p>
             <ol>
             <li>Start the Apache and Database servers if they are not already running.</li>
              <li>Open the "products controller" and scroll down to the case statement built in the previous activity (e.g. <code>case 'category':</code>)</li>
              <li>Find the line where the view should be included and add two new lines <b>before</b> that line.</li>
              <li>Add this code to the new lines you just created:
              <code class="callout no-left">
               echo $prodDisplay;<br>
               exit;
               </code>
              </li>
              <li>Save the controller file.</li>
              <li>Run the "acme controller". The acme home page should be delivered.</li>
              <li>Click one of the main navigation links.</li>
              <li>If things worked, you should be viewing an unordered list of products that belong to the category that you clicked. The images probably won't work, we'll fix that in the next activity.</li>
              <li>If things did not work, double check your code, get help, do whatever it takes to get things working.</li>
              <li>If things worked, "Well done" and you are ready to continue.</li>
              <li>Return to the "products controller" and comment out or delete the echo and exit lines that you added to do the testing.</li>
              <li>Save the "products controller".</li>

             </ol>
