    <h1>Enhancement 3</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>In this enhancement you will combine skills from the last two weeks to build a system into the acme web site that is capable of delivering both a registration and login view to a site visitor when the "My Account" link in the page header on the Acme site is clicked. This process will require use of the MVC architecture.</p>
    <h2>Video Demo</h2>
    <p>This short video demonstrates what your links and the flow of this enhancement could look like.</p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Work with your learning team to accomplish the tasks and post to and read the weekly discussion board to help one another.</li>
     <li>Make sure your acme template is using the "<b>$navList</b>" variable to provide the navigation bar as directed in the "Build a Dynamic Navigation Menu" activity, prior to doing step 3.</li>
     <li>Use your acme template to build a login view. The form will require the user to supply:
      <ul>
       <li>their email address</li>
       <li>their password</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure you use HTML5 and usability standards to build the view and form (e.g. use label elements with the input elements and use HTML5 input types for the input elements within the form).</p>
      <p>Use CSS to style the form for professional appearance and usability.</p>
      <p><strong>The form DOES NOT NEED TO ACTUALLY LOGIN AN INDIVIDUAL for this enhancement</strong>.</p>
     </li>
     <li>You will use your acme template to build a registration view. The view must contain a form that collects the following information from a site visitor:
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>First name</li>
       <li>Last name</li>
       <li>Email address</li>
       <li>A password</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ensure that the registrant understands that all fields are required.</p>
      <p>Make sure you use HTML5 and usability standards to build the view and form (e.g. use label elements with the input elements and use HTML5 input types for the input elements within the form).</p>
      <p>Use CSS to style the form for professional appearance and usability.</p>
      <p><strong>The form DOES NOT NEED TO ACTUALLY REGISTER AN INDIVIDUAL for this enhancement</strong>.</p>
     </li>
     <!--     The views are done, build the functionality  -->
     <li>Create a link in the header code snippet module for the "My Account" item. By doing it here, the link should appear in the acme template and all existing views (home, login, 500 error and registration).</li>
     <li>The link must point to the "<b>accounts</b>" controller and send a name-value (a.k.a. key - value) pair (remember the "action" name or key from the activities?) as a parameter that tells the controller to deliver the login view. <i>You may want to carefully study the links built in the dynamic navigation activity to see how the name-value pair is made part of the link.</i></li>
     <li>Alter the <b>accounts</b> controller to make the delivery request of the login view the default value of the <b>$action</b> variable (if no other value is found).</li>
     <li>Alter the existing switch case statement in the accounts controller to react to the "login" request and deliver the login view from the <b>view</b> folder.</li>
     <li>Create a link in the login view that tells the client to click it if they have not yet registered or need to create an account. The link must:
      <ul>
       <li>point to the "accounts" controller, and</li>
       <li>pass a name - value pair that tells the controller to deliver the registration view.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure the link is large and obvious so that it is not overlooked and causes a site visitor confusion. See this example from target.com:<br><img src="../images/acme/target-signin.png" alt="Signin example from target.com"></p>
     </li>
     <li>Add an additional case statement to the "accounts" controller to detect the request for the registration view and deliver it to the browser from the <b>view</b> folder.</li>
     <li>Save all of your work.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Test, Test, Test</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure XAMPP is running.</li>
 <li>Run the acme main controller.</li>
 <li>Click the "My Accounts" link in the header of the home page. The login view should be delivered to the browser.</li>
 <li>Click the "Create a New Account" link. The registration view should be delivered to the browser.</li>
 <li>Make sure that the URL in both links is pointing to the accounts controller and passing name - value pairs as parameters to deliver the respective views. <b>Under no circumstances should the links point directly to the view!</b></li>
 <li>Test the "My Account" link in all views to make sure it works in all of them.</li>
 <li>If things work "Clap your hands and shout Hooray!".</li>
 <li>If things don't work, go back and troubleshoot your code, ask for help, post to the discussion board, but <b>GET HELP</b> until it works.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Thoroughly test your links to ensure that they point to the accounts controller and that the correct views are delivered.</li>
     <li>Validate all views for HTML5 validity.</li>
     <li>Validate the CSS for validity.</li>
     <li>Double check your work to ensure that it meets all of the expectations listed.</li>
     <li>When satisfied that the code is operational:
      <ol>
       <li>Create a video that demonstrates:
        <ol>
         <li>That each of the links in the views work.</li>
         <li>That the home, login and registration views are valid html and css.</li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>Post your video to your YouTube channel and copy the link to the video when published.</li>
       <li>Zip the acme folder and name it enhancement 3 (save this zip file outside of your web site)</li>
       <li>Submit the zip file to the enhancement 3 assignment dropbox and add the video URL to the dropbox comment.</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
    <h3>Objective 1 Items</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>All views are valid HTML5 - 5 points (minus 1 for each error found)</li>
     <li>All views are valid CSS - 5 points (minus 1 for each error found)</li>
     <li>Total value of objective 1: <b>10 points</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Objective 3 Items</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>The "My Account" link points to the accounts controller and passes an appropriate name - value pair to request the login view and the view is delivered - 10 points (minus 3 points for each view that is missing this link)</li>
     <li>The registration link in the login view points to the accounts controller and passes an appropriate name - value pair to request the registration view and the view is delivered - 5 points (all or nothing)</li>
     <li>The accounts controller has additional and operable case statements to deliver the appropriate views according to the value of the $action variable - 5 points (all or nothing)</li>
     <li>Total value of objective 3: <b>20 points</b></li>
    </ul>
