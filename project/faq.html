        <h1>Dynamic Project FAQ</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>The Dynamic Project is where you demonstrate your mastery of the concepts, skills, and techniques learned in this course. Use the discussion boards to post questions and insights pertaining to the project in order to help one another plan, build, and complete the project.</p>
        
        <h2>What is the time line?</h2>
        <h3>Week 12</h3>
        <p>The project specifications will become available. This document will outline the purpose and requirements of the project. It will also provide entity relationship diagrams for the database you will need to build for the project. Week 12 will be a work week for you to begin building the project. Team and class collaboration and discussion are encouraged.</p>
        <h3>Week 13</h3>
        <p>Week 13 will be a work week for you to work on the project. Team and class collaboration and discussion are encouraged.</p>
        <h3>Week 14</h3>
        <p>Two <a href="peer-review.html" title="Read about the peer reviews" target="_blank">peer reviews</a> should be completed early in the week (Monday) by you and other members of the class in order to catch errors and provide one another feedback prior to the project being submitted. This will allow you to correct errors before grading.</p>
        <p>The dynamic project is due on the published last day of classes (see the class calendar) for teacher assessment. Make sure your project meets the criteria by <a href="matrix.html" title="Read the grading matrix" target="_blank">carefully reviewing the grading matrix</a> in advance.</p>
        
        <h2>What's the video?</h2>
        <p>The video shows you using your own finished project. It is expected that you will narrate the video while showing the fully functioning application. You can also use the video to demonstrate any special features of the application.</p>
        <p>The video is limited to 7 minutes to keep things concise and manageable.</p>
        <h2>How do I submit my work?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The code (in zip format) will be submitted to the project assignment dropbox on the last published day of classes by 11pm.
            <ol>
              <li>The zip file must be of the project folder containing all files needed for operation.</li>
              <li>A SQL file of the database (including tables and data) must be included in the zip file. The SQL file must be importable to a database of the name specified in the project documents and be capable of operation without any alteration.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>A video demonstrating your use of your project application must be created and the URL to the video submitted to the assignment dropbox (as a comment in the submission). The video is limited to 7 minutes.</li>
