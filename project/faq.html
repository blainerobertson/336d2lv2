        <h1>Final Project FAQ</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>The Final Project is where you demonstrate your mastery of the concepts, skills, and techniques learned in this course. Use the discussion boards and your learning teams to ask questions and share insights pertaining to the project in order to help one another plan, build, and complete the project.</p>

        <h2>What is the time line?</h2>
        <h3>Week 12</h3>
        <p>The project specifications will become available. This document will outline the purpose and requirements of the project. It will also provide database diagrams for the database functionality you will need to build for the project. Week 12 will be a work week for you to begin building the project. Team and class collaboration and discussion are encouraged.</p>
        <h3>Week 13</h3>
        <p>Week 13 will be a work week for you to work on the project. Team and class collaboration and discussion are encouraged.</p>
        <h3>Week 14</h3>
        <p>Two <a href="peer-review.html" title="Read about the peer reviews" target="_blank">peer reviews</a> should be completed by Monday. These peer evaluations are to catch errors and provide one another feedback prior to the project being submitted. This will allow you to correct errors before grading.</p>
        <p>The dynamic project is due on the published last day of classes (see the class calendar) for teacher assessment. Make sure your project meets the criteria by carefully reviewing the project grading matrix.</p>

        <h2>What's the video?</h2>
        <p>The project video, like the enhancement videos, shows you using your own finished project. It is expected that you will narrate the video while demonstrating the project as outlined in the project directions and grading matrix.</p>
        <p>The video is limited to 7 minutes to keep things concise and manageable.</p>
        <h2>How do I submit my work?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The code (in zip format) will be submitted to the project assignment dropbox on the last published day of classes by 12pm (Noon) Rexburg time.
            <ol>
              <li>The zip file must be of the project folder containing all files needed for operation.</li>
              <li>A SQL file of the database (including tables and data) must be included in the zip file. The SQL file must be importable to a database of the name specified in the project documents and be capable of operation without any alteration.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>A video demonstrating your use of your project application must be created and the URL to the video submitted to the assignment dropbox (as a comment in the submission). The video is limited to 7 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
