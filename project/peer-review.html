				<h1>Peer Review</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>A peer review is exactly what it sounds like, a review of your dynamic project by another member of the class. The review will be conducted using the <a href="336_peer_review.xltx" title="Download the Excel template in a new tab" target="_blank">peer review template</a> file (an Excel template) which is based on the provided <a href="matrix.html" title="Review the matrix in a new tab" target="_blank">grading matrix</a>.</p>

				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>By having another class member look at your site, they may catch errors or find items that are confusing. By providing you feedback on these items it gives you an opportunity to make corrections before the project is actually graded.</p>

				<h2>When?</h2>
				<p>Your project should be close to being complete. Therefore, it should be done within 72 hours of when the project is due. That gives you time to make corrections but not so far in advance that the project is not close to being done.</p>

				<h2>How?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Students will work with 2 other members of the class to conduct the reviews.</li>
					<li>You are required to review the dynamic project of at least 2 of your peers and likewise receive at least 2 peer reviews of your own project.</li>
					<li>Be sure to coordinate between yourselves to ensure that everyone receives the 2 required peer reviews.</li>
					<li>Use the <a href="336_peer_review.xltx" title="Download the Excel template in a new tab" target="_blank">peer review template</a> to conduct the review of each project.</li>
						<li>Save the review document using the developer's name and "project review" (e.g. Sally Smith project review.xslx).</li>
					<li>Email a copy of your review document to the site developer for his/her use.</li>
					<li>Submit the peer review documents which you conducted (2 total) to the Peer Review dropbox in the week 13 module. <strong>(Note: These are the reviews you did for other people, not the ones they did for you!)</strong></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Grading</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>You will be given 5 points per peer review that you conduct (10 points total). This grading will be done from the submitted reviews in the Peer Review Assignment drop box.</li>
					<li>If you fail to participate in the peer review process you will lose the 10 points for the two peer reviews AND your dynamic project score will also be penalized 50%! [<b>Yes! This is how important I believe the peer reviews can be!</b>]</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Benefit</h2>
				<p>By having another pair of eyes review your project they will see things that you will not. By finding and pointing out errors, ommissions or confusing operations you can make fixes and better your grade when things are assessed by the professor.</p>
