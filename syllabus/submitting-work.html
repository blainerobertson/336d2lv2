    <h1>Submitting Work</h1>
    <dl style="line-height: 1.5">
     <dt><b>Q: How will I submit my work?</b></dt>
     <dd><b>A:</b> All work for this class is done and submitted to the designated weekly assignment dropbox as a zip file of the folder containing the work. In addition, you will create a screencast of the finished work and post the URL to the assignment dropbox comment.</dd>

     <dt><b>Q: How will the professor or teaching assistant find my work to assess it?</b></dt>

     <dd><b>A:&nbsp;</b>They will look in the assignment dropbox for the week to find your submission.</dd>

     <dt><b>Q: How will the grader see my database?</b></dt>

     <dd><b>A:</b> In some cases, the professor or teaching assistant may visit with you individually where you will be asked to show your database at that time. However, in most cases everyone will be using a database with the same name and containing the same tables. Your submitted code should work with any version of the database.</dd>

     <dt><b>Q: In the grade book, I see the name of assessments listed more than once. Each one has a different number accompanying it. Why the duplicates?</b></dt>

     <dd><b>A:</b> Each number refers to a course objective. This class is graded based on demonstrated mastery of course objectives. In order for the I-Learn grade book to accept a score for each objective that a particular assessment may include, it requires a separate grade book entry.</dd>

     <dt><b>Q: What if I have questions about completing or submitting an assessment?</b></dt>

     <dd><b>A:</b> Use the Discussion Boards (early) to ask your question because chances are that if you have a question, others will also have that same question. Then, when someone finds the answer and posts it, everybody now the answer. The professor will monitor the Discussion Board for each week, and if another student doesn&rsquo;t answer your question, the professor will, or you can always ask the professor or teaching assistant directly.</dd>

     <dt><b>Q: Why am I required to work with others on my assessments?</b></dt>

     <dd><b>A:</b> The number one skill we hear from employers that hire our students is that they want people who can work with others. You are still expected to do your own work, but you have to be able to collaborate and communicate. By requiring you to work together to solve the problems and build the necessary tools to complete the task, you learn how to successfully cooperate and communicate with other people.</dd>
