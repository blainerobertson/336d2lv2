        <h1>Collaboration</h1>
        <p>Collaboration - the ability to work together to accomplish a task, goal or outcome - is a skill that is consistently mentioned by employers as a requirement for new and seasoned employees. In this course you will be requried to work with others on a weekly basis using both the discussion board and team meetings. Each individual is responsible for her or his own work, but interacting, supporting, assisting and collaborating are desirable and required in this class.</p>
        <h2>Work Team</h2>
        <p>During week 2 you will organize yourselves into teams of 3 or 4. In an online environment it is strongly suggested that you work with others in or near your own timezone whenever possible. The team will become your primary source for feedback and help. You are required to meet together each week to discuss the content of the week, assessments, insights and help one another with these things. These team meetings will be arranged for a location (face-to-face, Skype, Google Hangouts, etc...) and time that is acceptable to those in the team. Your attendance at and participation in the weekly meeting will be graded.</p>
        <h2>Discussion Board</h2>
        <p>Each week has a discussion board for the entire class. You are expected to participate in the discussion board weekly. Specifically, it is expected that you will post at least 1 question, answer or outside resource that contributes to the weekly topic(s) by Wednesday and then follow up at least one more time before Saturday at 11pm. The key word here is <i>"meaningful"</i>. It is expected that your participation is truly assisting the class and its members to move forward! Your participation will be graded.</p>
