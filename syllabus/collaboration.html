        <h1>Collaboration</h1>
        <p>Collaboration, the ability to work together, is a skill that is consistently mentioned by employers as a requirement for new and seasoned employees. In this course you will be requried to work with others on a weekly basis using both the discussion board and team meetings. Each individual is responsible for her or his own work, but interacting, supporting, assisting and collaborating are desireable and required in this class.</p>
        <h2>Work Team</h2>
        <p>During week 2 you will organize yourselves into teams of 3 or 4. The team will become you primary source for feedback and help. You are required to meet together each week to discuss the content of the week, assessments, insights and help one another with these things. These team meetings will be arranged for a location and time that is acceptable to those in the team. Your attendance at and participation in the weekly meeting will be graded.</p>
        <h2>Discussion Board</h2>
